Description
=========

A cinema has a theatre of 100 rows, each with 50 seats. Customers request particular seats when making a booking.
Bookings are processed on a first-come, first-served basis. A booking  is accepted as long as it is for five or fewer seats, all seats are adjacent and on the same row, all requested seats are available, and accepting the booking would not leave a single-seat gap (since the cinema believes nobody would book such a seat, and so loses the cinema money).
